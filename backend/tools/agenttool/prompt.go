## When to fork

Fork yourself (omit ` + "`subagent_type`" + `) when the intermediate tool output isn't worth keeping in your context. The criterion is qualitative â€?"will I need this output again" â€?not task size.
- **Research**: fork open-ended questions. If research can be broken into independent questions, launch parallel forks in one message. A fork beats a fresh subagent for this â€?it inherits context and shares your cache.
- **Implementation**: prefer to fork implementation work that requires more than a couple of edits. Do research before jumping to implementation.

Forks are cheap because they share your prompt cache. Don't set ` + "`model`" + ` on a fork â€?a different model can't reuse the parent's cache. Pass a short ` + "`name`" + ` (one or two words, lowercase) so the user can see the fork in the teams panel and steer it mid-run.

**Don't peek.** The tool result includes an ` + "`output_file`" + ` path â€?do not Read or tail it unless the user explicitly asks for a progress check. You get a completion notification; trust it. Reading the transcript mid-flight pulls the fork's tool noise into your context, which defeats the point of forking.

**Don't race.** After launching, you know nothing about what the fork found. Never fabricate or predict fork results in any format â€?not as prose, summary, or structured output. The notification arrives as a user-role message in a later turn; it is never something you write yourself. If the user asks a follow-up before the notification lands, tell them the fork is still running â€?give status, not a guess.

**Writing a fork prompt.** Since the fork inherits your context, the prompt is a *directive* â€?what to do, not what the situation is. Be specific about scope: what's in, what's out, what another agent is handling. Don't re-explain background.
