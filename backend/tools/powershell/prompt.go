// buildPrompt renders the PowerShell tool prompt. The structure mirrors

// guidance) but swaps in PowerShell-specific syntax, cmdlet-vs-alias
// advice, and an edition-aware warning block.
//
// PowerShell edition branching:
//
//   - desktop (Windows PowerShell 5.1): no pipeline chain operators
//     (`&&`/`||`), no ternary, ASCII output defaults. We warn the model
//     explicitly.
//   - core (PowerShell 7+): `&&`/`||`, ternary, UTF-8 output --we tell
//     the model it is safe to use them.
//   - unknown / not detected: we stay conservative and emit the 5.1
//     guidance.

Only create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:

Git Safety Protocol:
- NEVER update the git config
- NEVER run destructive git commands (push --force, reset --hard, checkout ., restore ., clean -f, branch -D) unless the user explicitly requests them
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it
- NEVER run force push to main/master; warn the user if they request it
- CRITICAL: Always create NEW commits rather than amending. If a pre-commit hook fails, fix the issue, re-stage, and create a NEW commit
- When staging files, prefer adding specific files by name rather than ` + "`git add -A`" + ` / ` + "`git add .`" + `
- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to

1. Run the following git commands in parallel via ` + shellRef + `:
  - ` + "`git status`" + ` (do NOT pass -uall on large repos)
  - ` + "`git diff`" + ` (staged and unstaged)
  - ` + "`git log --oneline -n 20`" + ` for style reference
2. Analyze the changes and draft a concise, "why"-focused commit message.
3. Stage the relevant files, create the commit, and run ` + "`git status`" + ` to verify.
4. If the commit fails due to a pre-commit hook: fix the issue and create a NEW commit.

Use a PowerShell here-string to pass multi-line commit messages:
<example>
$msg = @'
Commit message here.
'@
git commit -m $msg
</example>

Important notes:
- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code besides git commands
- NEVER use the ` + todoRef + ` or ` + agentRef + ` tools
- DO NOT push unless the user explicitly asks
- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (interactive) since they require input
- If there are no changes to commit, do not create an empty commit

# Creating pull requests
Use ` + "`gh`" + ` (or ` + "`gh.exe`" + `) via the ` + shellRef + ` tool for all GitHub tasks --issues, pull requests, checks, releases. If given a GitHub URL, use ` + "`gh`" + ` to fetch the info you need.

1. Run the following in parallel to understand branch state:
   - ` + "`git status`" + ` (no -uall)
   - ` + "`git diff`" + ` (staged + unstaged)
   - ` + "`git log`" + ` and ` + "`git diff [base]...HEAD`" + ` for the commit history since divergence
2. Draft a PR title (< 70 chars) and a markdown body with Summary + Test plan.
3. In parallel: create/push the branch (with -u), then open the PR. Use a here-string for the body:
<example>
$body = @'
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points>

## Test plan
[Bulleted markdown checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]
'@
gh pr create --title "the pr title" --body $body
</example>

Important:
- DO NOT use the ` + todoRef + ` or ` + agentRef + ` tools
- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it

# Other common operations
- View comments on a GitHub PR: ` + "`gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments`"
}
