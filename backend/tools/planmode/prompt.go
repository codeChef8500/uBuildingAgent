Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.

## When to Use This Tool

**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:

1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality
   - Example: "Add a logout button" - where should it go? What should happen on click?
   - Example: "Add form validation" - what rules? What error messages?

2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways
   - Example: "Add caching to the API" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.
   - Example: "Improve performance" - many optimization strategies possible

3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure
   - Example: "Update the login flow" - what exactly should change?
   - Example: "Refactor this component" - what's the target architecture?

4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies
   - Example: "Add real-time updates" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling
   - Example: "Implement state management" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution

5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files
   - Example: "Refactor the authentication system"
   - Example: "Add a new API endpoint with tests"

6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope
   - Example: "Make the app faster" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks
   - Example: "Fix the bug in checkout" - need to investigate root cause

7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways
   - If you would use ` + askUserRef + ` to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead
   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Only skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:
- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)
- Adding a single function with clear requirements
- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions
- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Agent tool with explore agent instead)

` + whatHappens + `## Examples

### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Add user authentication to the app"
- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)

User: "Optimize the database queries"
- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact

User: "Implement dark mode"
- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components

User: "Add a delete button to the user profile"
- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates

User: "Update the error handling in the API"
- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach

### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Fix the typo in the README"
- Straightforward, no planning needed

User: "Add a console.log to debug this function"
- Simple, obvious implementation

User: "What files handle routing?"
- Research task, not implementation planning

## Important Notes

- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode
- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work
- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase

	return `Use this tool when a task has genuine ambiguity about the right approach and getting user input before coding would prevent significant rework. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.

## When to Use This Tool

Plan mode is valuable when the implementation approach is genuinely unclear. Use it when:

1. **Significant Architectural Ambiguity**: Multiple reasonable approaches exist and the choice meaningfully affects the codebase
   - Example: "Add caching to the API" - Redis vs in-memory vs file-based
   - Example: "Add real-time updates" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling

2. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore and clarify before you can make progress
   - Example: "Make the app faster" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks
   - Example: "Refactor this module" - need to understand what the target architecture should be

3. **High-Impact Restructuring**: The task will significantly restructure existing code and getting buy-in first reduces risk
   - Example: "Redesign the authentication system"
   - Example: "Migrate from one state management approach to another"

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip plan mode when you can reasonably infer the right approach:
- The task is straightforward even if it touches multiple files
- The user's request is specific enough that the implementation path is clear
- You're adding a feature with an obvious implementation pattern (e.g., adding a button, a new endpoint following existing conventions)
- Bug fixes where the fix is clear once you understand the bug
- Research/exploration tasks (use the Agent tool instead)
- The user says something like "can we work on X" or "let's do X" â€?just get started

When in doubt, prefer starting work and using ` + askUserRef + ` for specific questions over entering a full planning phase.

` + whatHappens + `## Examples

### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Add user authentication to the app"
- Genuinely ambiguous: session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure

User: "Redesign the data pipeline"
- Major restructuring where the wrong approach wastes significant effort

### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Add a delete button to the user profile"
- Implementation path is clear; just do it

User: "Can we work on the search feature?"
- User wants to get started, not plan

User: "Update the error handling in the API"
- Start working; ask specific questions if needed

User: "Fix the typo in the README"
- Straightforward, no planning needed

	return `Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.

## How This Tool Works
- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message
- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote
- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve
- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it

## When to Use This Tool
IMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.

## Before Using This Tool
Ensure your plan is complete and unambiguous:
- If you have unresolved questions about requirements or approach, use ` + askUserRef + ` first (in earlier phases)
- Once your plan is finalized, use THIS tool to request approval

**Important:** Do NOT use ` + askUserRef + ` to ask "Is this plan okay?" or "Should I proceed?" - that's exactly what THIS tool does. ExitPlanMode inherently requests user approval of your plan.

## Examples

1. Initial task: "Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.
2. Initial task: "Help me implement yank mode for vim" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.
3. Initial task: "Add a new feature to handle user authentication" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use ` + askUserRef + ` first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.
